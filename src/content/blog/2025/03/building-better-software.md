At Iniva, we believe that great software is built on solid foundations. Our approach combines modern best practices with time-tested principles.

## Core Principles

We focus on three key areas when building software:

- **Simplicity** - Choose the simplest solution that solves the problem
- **Maintainability** - Write code that's easy to understand and modify
- **Performance** - Optimize for real-world usage patterns

## Modern Tools, Timeless Principles

While we embrace modern tools and frameworks, we never lose sight of fundamental software engineering principles. Clean architecture, solid testing practices, and thoughtful design always come first.

The best code is code that doesn't need to exist. Before adding complexity, we always ask: is there a simpler way?
