Every company has an origin story. Ours started with a simple observation: too much modern software is bloated, complex, and frustrating to use.

## The Problem

We've all experienced it. Apps that take forever to load. Interfaces that require a PhD to understand. Features that nobody asked for getting in the way of what you actually need to do.

The software industry has a habit of making things more complicated than they need to be.

## Our Solution

At Iniva, we're taking a different approach. We build software that:

- Loads fast and stays fast
- Does one thing extremely well
- Gets out of your way so you can focus on your work

## Looking Forward

We're just getting started. Our goal is to build a portfolio of products that prove you don't need bloat to create great software.

Join us on this journey. We're building something special.
