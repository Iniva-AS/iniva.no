# Iniva Site Strategy Guide

## Intent

- Position Iniva as the studio behind a growing suite of products, so every product inherits trust from the parent brand.
- Elevate your personal credibility as founder/engineer while keeping the public-facing voice in one place.
- Keep the door open for rare, high-leverage collaborations that strengthen Iniva products or reputation.
- Maintain optionality for a future standalone personal brand without fragmenting effort today.

## Guiding Principles

- **Lead with the mission**: Frame Iniva as the place inventing tools that solves real business problems.
- **Show proof, not promises**: Use shipped products and outcomes as the primary evidence of capability.
- **Selective partnerships**: Make it clear you partner only when a project is exceptional and aligned with your roadmap.

## Audience Snapshot

- **Product customers** who need confidence that Quick3, PCKasse, and future launches are reliable, supported solutions.
- **Aspirational observers** (partners, investors, talent) who should see you as a founder building momentum.
- **Rare collaborators** who must recognize the bar for engagement is extremely high.

## Core Narrative (Hero Section)

1. Opening statement: “Building tools for businesses operators who demand more.” (We need to rephrase here).
2. Subtext: Emphasize 10 years of expertise now focused on shipping your own products. (We need to rephrase here)
3. CTA pairing: primary button to explore the flagship product, secondary link to view the full product suite.

## Site Architecture

- **Mission strip**: Concise articulation of what Iniva stands for and the problem space you own.
- **Product portfolio**: Card-based section that highlights each active product (logo lockup, one-line value prop, core result, CTA).
- **Proof block**: Metrics, testimonials, or mini case stories that show the impact of Quick3 and upcoming PCKasse.
- **Founder/Studio credibility**: Brief story about your background, emphasizing the transition from consulting to product leadership.
- **Selective partnerships**: Short paragraph inviting conversations only for “insane” opportunities, with language that sets expectations (“We occasionally partner when it amplifies what we’re building—tell us why yours should be next.”).
- **Journal**: A single publishing feed where you write in your own voice; pieces are signed “— Ole Herland, Founder of Iniva” to blend personal thought leadership with the studio narrative.
- **Footer**: Persistent “An Iniva product” line plus links back to each product domain; reuse this footer snippet on product sites.

## Product Cross-Linking Pattern

- Each product site should include an “Designed by Iniva” badge, a one-sentence description of the studio, and a link back to Iniva.no for the full story.
- Iniva.no should reciprocate with product cards, outlining how each product fits the broader vision and the result it delivers.
- When a product matures into its own brand, keep the Iniva attribution in the footer and feature it on the Iniva product portfolio page as a success story.

## Voice and Tone

- Confident, concise, product-driven. Avoid agency jargon and over-selling consulting services.
- Use active language that signals momentum (“We ship”, “We built”, “We operate”), reflecting that you are already executing.
- When referencing consulting, use scarcity language (“occasionally”, “select”) to reinforce exclusivity.
- Let personal perspective show up in the journal—opinionated, reflective, founder-first—so readers feel the human behind the brand without needing a separate blog.

## Personal Brand Integration

- Iniva.no is going to be my main place for writing articles. Build up the iniva brand first, then my personal brand can piggy-back later.

## Content Backlog

- Snapshots of real product usage (screenshots, metrics, user quotes) for Quick3-plugin and PCKasse-plugin.
- Timeline or roadmap highlight showing recent launches and upcoming milestones.
- Short founder note or manifesto about why Iniva builds products instead of chasing client work.
- FAQ entries addressing product support, roadmap transparency, and how to request a special collaboration.
- One or two flagship journal essays that tell the decade-long journey and the “why now” for the product suite.
- Reference content for extraordinary client collaborations—what qualifies, past wins, how it accelerates product vision.
